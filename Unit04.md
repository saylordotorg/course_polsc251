**Unit 4: Data and Measurement** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn how political scientists use data and
measurement to understand and quantify political phenomena. You will
first examine the measurement process, learning the importance of
clearly defining the concepts and political phenomena that you are
studying. This unit will also take a look at the concepts of the
dependent and independent variable in research design and how their
characteristics impact the measurement process. Finally, you will learn
about data in its many forms, discovering how it is collected and used
in the research process. By the end of this unit, you should have a
clear understanding of the preliminary steps required for the successful
implementation of research design.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you should be able to
-   describe the theory that underlies sampling;
-   describe several different types of samples and discuss their
    strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate uses;

**4.1.1 Qualitative Data** <span id="4.1.1"></span> 
Note: This topic is covered by the material beneath subunit 4.1. There
are only two types of data: qualitative and quantitative. Pay close
attention to the distinction between the two. Being able to define
qualitative data is necessary to fully understand Unit 7.

**4.1.2 Quantitative Data** <span id="4.1.2"></span> 
Note: This topic is covered by the material beneath subunit 4.1 There
are only two types of data: qualitative and quantitative data. Pay close
attention to the distinction between the two. Being able to define
quantitative data is necessary to fully understand Unit 5 and 6.
