Course Syllabus for "POLSC251: Research Methods in Political Science"
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Research is an important component of political science; it enables us
to uncover evidence, develop theories, and better understand how the
political world operates. This course will introduce you to some of the
basic research tools in the political scientist’s “toolkit,” and discuss
why and how certain tools are used to explore certain phenomena. The
course will also teach you to develop and evaluate sensible and
systematic scientific research designs by addressing the ways in which
data and theory intersect and examining how political scientists
quantify, measure, and operationalize the concepts and variables that
are key to understanding the political world. You will conclude your
studies by learning about the practical implementation of research
design. By the end of this course, you will better understand the
qualitative and quantitative techniques that are used within the field
and will be able to explain why political scientists choose to use them.
In this regard, you will have the opportunity to use data and
statistical analysis to gain an appreciation for the methodological
choices that researchers in the field make as they conduct research.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to  

-   describe the relationship between the scientific method and
    political science;
-   formulate research questions, theories, and hypotheses;
-   describe the basics of the standard research approaches in political
    science;
-   evaluate the soundness of a research design;
-   perform basic statistical analyses; and
-   execute basic research in the political science discipline. 

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must  
  
 √    have access to a computer;  
  
 √    have continuous broadband Internet access;  
  
 √    have the ability/permission to install plug-ins (e.g. Adobe Reader

### Course Information

Welcome to Research Methods in Political Science. General information
about this course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   iTunes U: East Tennessee State University: Dr. Blake Snider’s
    *Research Methods* Lecture Series from [Fall
    2006](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/dr.-sniders-research-methods/id384931206) and
    [Spring
    2007](http://itunes.apple.com/hn/itunes-u/dr.-sniders-research-methods/id384931184)
-   Wadsworth Cengage Learning: [“Statistics
    Workshops”](http://www.wadsworth.com/psychology_d/templates/student_resources/workshops/stats_wrk.html)
-   Wadsworth Cengage Learning: [“Research Methods
    Workshops”](http://www.wadsworth.com/psychology_d/templates/student_resources/workshops/resch_wrk.html)
-   Web Center for Social Research Methods: William M.K. Trochim’s
    *[Research Methods Knowledge
    Base](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/contents.php)*
-   [Directory of Open Access
    Journals](http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=loadTempl&templ=about&uiLanguage=en)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Units 1 and 2 will lay the foundation for understanding how the
scientific method relates to political science. This will be essential
to understanding the rest of the course. You will also need to complete
the following:

-   Subunit 1.1 Quiz
-   Subunit 4.1.1 Quiz
-   Subunit 4.1.2 Quiz
-   Subunit 4.2 Quiz
-   Subunit 4.2.3 Quiz
-   Subunit 4.5
-   Subunit 5.1
-   Subunit 5.2
-   Subunit 6.2.2 Quiz
-   Subunit 6.2.3
-   Subunit 6.2.4
-   Subunit 6.3
-   Subunit 6.3.2
-   Subunit 6.3.4
-   Subunit 6.4.2
-   Subunit 8.1
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the quizzes and problem sets listed above.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **91
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a *time advisory* that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 6.5 hours. Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total
of 2.5 hours) on Monday night; Subunits 1.2 and 1.3 (a total of 2.5
hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** As noted in the *Course Requirements*, you will
need basic math skills to complete this course. While this is not a
class in statistics, you will need to understand some basic probability
theory and statistical applications. You will not need to calculate
statistics by hand. I would suggest thinking about the big picture in
the quantitative analysis sections in Units 5 and 6. Do not get bogged
down in understanding the details of the calculations. Rather, focus on
how these methods can be used to answer political science research
questions.  
    
 As you read, take careful notes on a separate sheet of paper. The
article [“Guidelines for Effective Reading and Not
Taking”](http://livepage.apple.com/) is useful in providing direction in
your reading and note taking in this course.
