**Unit 5: Quantitative Methods: Descriptive Statistics** <span
id="5"></span> 
*Once political scientists obtain and understand their data, they must
find a way to describe it. In this unit, you will learn how political
scientists present their data through the use of statistics, exploring
some basic statistical concepts including mean, median, and mode. By the
end of this unit, you will know how to perform some foundational
statistical analysis.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 10 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.1: 5 hours

 ☐    Subunit 5.2.2: 1.5 hours

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you should be able to
-   describe how political scientists assess the dispersion of data;
-   calculate measures of central tendency; and
-   discuss how comparisons across variables are made.
