**Unit 7: Qualitative Methods** <span id="7"></span> 
*Not all research in political science is suited for quantitative
analysis. More often than not, quantitative analysis is reserved for*
large-n *research, or research in which political scientists take a
large sample from a population and make generalizations about that
population. Sometimes political scientists use* small-n *research, where
the number of cases included in the study is much smaller. This* small-n
*research is often times qualitative; it provides a different outlook on
political phenomena than does* large-n *quantitative research. In the
first subunit, you will explore the benefits and drawbacks of using*
small-n*, qualitative research. This unit will also cover three forms of
qualitative analysis: participant observation, in-depth interviews, and
focus group analysis. As with all forms of research, these approaches
have their respective advantages and disadvantages.*
