**Unit 3: Research Design** <span id="3"></span> 
*Before conducting any research, you must create a logical research
plan. This unit will detail the standard structure of a research
article/project, identify the steps that you should take in order to
formulate a strong research design, and present you with an introduction
to various types of research designs used in political science in the
process.  
  
 After detailing the standard structure of a research article/project,
we will take a careful look at causal relationships and how they (or
assumptions about them) play into research in political science. In
previous courses, you learned how to identify and analyze empirical or
observable relationships between two variables. In scientific research,
however, you must identify the causal relationship between two variables
in order to determine whether certain factors produce a particular
outcome.  
  
 You will then explore the many types of research designs that political
scientists use, focusing first on experimental designs, where political
scientists manipulate and control variables in unnatural environments in
order to test their theories. We will discuss how different experiments
are designed and used and weigh their potential strengths and
weaknesses. The unit will then present other types of research design,
including surveys, data collection pertaining to naturally occurring
phenomena, and case studies. Each of these research designs plays an
important role within the discipline, though all have drawbacks.*
