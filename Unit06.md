**Unit 6: Quantitative Methods: Inferential Statistics** <span
id="6"></span> 
*In the last unit, you learned about descriptive statistics, where the
goal is to describe and compare variables within a given sample. In this
unit, you will learn to use inferential statistics, where the goal is to
use a sample to make inferences about the characteristics or
relationships in a larger population. You will first learn how to create
a sample that represents the qualities and characteristics of a larger
population. From there, the unit will delve into the application of
inferential statistics, discussing ways of determining whether the
sample that you have created is truly representative of the larger
population in question. You will learn about statistical significance
and other indicators that help determine the strength of your sample and
hypothesis and look further into the relationships between variables.  
    
 The unit will then discuss the concept of correlation as well as the
more complex relationships that regression analysis enables you to
discover. Regression analysis allows you to understand the condition and
strength of an association between an independent variable and a
dependent variable. In this section, you will first learn about more
basic, linear regression and then move on to more complex, multivariate,
multiple regression analysis. By the end of the unit, you should be able
to define a representative sample and run both simple correlation and
complex regression analyses to uncover statistically significant
relationships between variables in a model.*
