**Unit 8: Ethics in Social Science Research** <span id="8"></span> 
*We primarily study people in social science research. As a result,
ethical issues may come up. The central issue that arises is the risk of
harm to human participants in such studies. Such harms may be social,
psychological, emotional, financial, or legal. Social harms may include
having something about a participant that could embarrass the
participant. Psychological or emotional harms may result from being
deceived in the study. A participants’ employment security may be
jeopardized because of participation in a research study. Finally, legal
harms may result from the exposure of participants’ involvement in
illegal actions. With that said, most research projects in the social
sciences are what we would classify as being minimal risk of harm. That
does not mean, however, that we should then not address and consider the
risk of potential harms to participants in such studies. This unit will
cover how the social sciences have addressed these ethical concerns.*
