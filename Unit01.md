**Unit 1: The Science of Politics** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will serve as an introduction to the scientific study of
politics. As a social science, political science straddles both the*
hard *and* soft *science worlds. Hard science is characterized by strict
and rigorous scientific standards with close attention to formal
standards for hypothesis formulation and testing. Soft sciences are more
informal relying on interpretive approaches. Thus, political science
borrows research methods and theories from various other disciplines –
history, economics, psychology, anthropology, and even biology and
neurology. The reading for this unit and other units will rely heavily
on a general social science text supplemented with political science
examples. In this unit, you will define political science as a field of
research, and you will discuss how and what political scientists study.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 4.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 1.5 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you should be able to
-   describe the basic principles of the scientific method;
-   give a basic description of political science and its history;
-   discuss whether political science is actually scientific; and

    process in political science such unit of analysis, variables, and
    hypotheses.

     Instructions: Please read this article. Note that this article
    challenges the idea that political science can be scientific. You
    may recognize this article from
    [POLSC101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/polsc101/). Here, you
    should try to compare this article to the first article by The
    Writing Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in
    this subunit. The first article asserts that political science can
    be scientific, and this one challenges that perspective. Make sure
    to take notes on the claims based on each article, and try to
    develop your own reasoning as to what makes this discipline
    scientific or not.
