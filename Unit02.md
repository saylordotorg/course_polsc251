title: "POLSC251: Research Methods in Political Science"
course_description: "An introductory course on the basic research tools used in political science that examines the ways in which data and theory intersect and how political scientists quantify and measure the concepts and variables that aid in understanding the world."

**Unit 2: Foundations: Theories and Hypotheses** <span id="2"></span> 
*Before you design, conduct, and evaluate research in the field of
political science, you must understand the nuts and bolts of study in a
more general sense. This unit will define the terms* theory* and*
hypothesis* and will provide you with some pointers on how to develop
and test them. By the end of this unit, you will understand how theories
are formulated and how they can help you develop clear, scientific
hypotheses that can be tested through the research process. *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 4 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.4: 30 minutes

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you should be able to
-   describe the basic principles of theory in science;
-   give a basic description of a hypothesis and it components;
-   discuss the relationship between theory and hypotheses; and
-   formulate hypotheses for testing.

**2.1.1 Paradigms and Theory** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
*Note: Thomas Kuhn and Imre Lakatos prominently wrote and influence the
way scientists in many fields thought about the development of theories
and paradigmatic shifts in assumptions about what can be known and
studied. The readings below introduce you to Kuhn and Lakatos and their
principle ideas and influence.*

     Instructions: Please read this article, which makes clear that a
    hypothesis is derived from a theory in deductive reasoning and it
    goes the opposite way when using inductive reasoning. Deductive
    reasoning is preferable in scientific research, but in instances
    where we do not have clear theory, inductive reasoning may be
    used.
